## Intro
Welcome to Horror Tower, an idle tower defense game. Defend your singular upgradable tower against waves of monstrous enemies, some key features include:

 1. Free to play! No time-based energy systems or money pits to be able to play the game, play as much as you want.
 2. Endless gameplay - endlessly upgrade & grow your tower while killing hordes of enemies: zombies, vampires, gargoyles, ghosts, and more!
 3. Idle Mode: Want to see how far your current tower design can last? Enable Idle Mode and check your progress when you get a break to do so!
 4. Shop: Optional purchases you can make to improve your gameplay experience, keyword: optional!
 
 ## Setup
 The game is still in development, developers can go here for the Github repo (you will need access of course as its private):
 #### Defold Mobile 

This project was created from the "mobile" project template. This means that the settings in ["game.project"](defold://open?path=/game.project) have been changed to be suitable for a mobile game:
```
- The screen size is set to 1280x720.
- The projection is set to Fixed Fit.
- Orientation is fixed to landscape.
- Android and iOS icons are set (but art is placeholder/blank).
- iOS launch images (blank ones) are set
- Mouse click/single touch is bound to action "touch".
- Accelerometer input is turned off (for better battery life)
- Vsync is disabled in project settings (for older phones).
```
